                    <h2>Brady Kuhn</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at Iowa State University with an academic focus on circuit and PCB design, electromagnetics, and nondestructive evaluation. From my time working at the Iowa State Electronics and Technology Group, I've developed a strong foundation in PCB design, assembly, and troubleshooting. I am excited to continue my journey and begin my career when I graduate in May 2026.

                    <p>
                        In my free time, I like to golf, go hiking, and ride motorcycles.

                    <h3>Career Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        As my graduation approaches, I am actively seeking a full-time position as an Electrical Design Engineer. My passion is electrical hardware and I would love to work in consumer electronics so I can design products that I'd see people use in their day-to-day lives. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, contribute to innovative projects, and grow as a individual. Eventually, I would love to pursue a leadership role in engineering management so I can bring up young engineers and help them grow in their careers as others have done for me.
